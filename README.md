### Demonstration
* You can see the demonstration included in the folder.
* The reason why when I added 2 new category into the list and its id incremented to 26 and 27 respectively, that is because I have added some categories before to test this app and I use int identity type for CategoryID which auto-incremented by 1 when user added a new category.
### How to run this project?
* You can run either through downloading zip file or cloning this repository. After that, you will need to install Microsoft.Data.SqlClient in Nuget Package Manager to connect to the database.
