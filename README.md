### Demonstration
* ![Video](./demo/demo.mp4)
* The reason why when I added 2 new category into the list and its id incremented to 26 and 27 respectively, that is because I have added some categories before to test this app and I use int identity type for CategoryID which auto-incremented by 1 when user added a new category.
